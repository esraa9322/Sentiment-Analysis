# Sentiment-Analysis
  # Project Description:
     This is an NLP project that classifies tweets to positive and negative ones based on the count of the words that appear in the tweet using TF-IDF vectorizer and 
     Random forest classifier and got an accurcy of 72%.
     As the data contains a wide range of feelings I classified all those sentiments to only positive and negative feelings
